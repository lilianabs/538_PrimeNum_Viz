# 538_PrimeNum_Viz

This is a reproduction of the visualization from the article [We Have A New Prime Number, And Itâ€™s 23 Million Digits Long](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-have-a-new-prime-number-and-its-23-million-digits-long/).

We scrapped the data using the script scrapper_mersenned_primes.py. The code to reproduce the graph is in notebook Prime numbers digits visualization.ipynb. 

This is a work in progress :)
